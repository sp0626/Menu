Create a **3 page** website for a resturant menu.

## The Home page should resemble the Breakfast menu. 
Your website should look like the following:

* The top of the page needs to have a title with the name of the resurant similar to the one in the image.
* You need to add a way to navigate to all 3 pages (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner)
* Rather than images at the top, find any 3 breakfast item images on the internet and place them in a carousel. *All images must be the same size.*
* There should be at least 2 columns (categories) of breakfast items.
* There should be at least 4 items in each column (8 breakfast items total)
* Each menu item needs a name, descripton and a price.


## The Lunch Menu page should resemble the Breakfast menu as well.

Same Layout, differnt menu categories and items.
* Lunch does not need a carousel, just 3 lunch item images.

## The Treats Menu
Your Treats page should look like the following:
![Treats Layout](assets/Dessert-.png)

* You need at least 4 Treat menu items and 4 treat item images.
    * The images should be to the left and right of the treat items like the layout shown.
* Every Treat item on the menu needs a name, description, and price.

## Style

* Use the following colors to style your site: ![color swatches](assets/colors.png)
* You should have a border around the columns of menu items
* At the top of each page you should attempt to replicate the heading style as best as you can.
    * Outer sections have dark gray background and white/cream text.
    * Middle section has the menu name and the time of day it is served.
